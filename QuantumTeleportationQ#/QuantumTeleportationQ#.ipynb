    "Quantum teleportation is a critical concepts to take advantage of the powers of quantum information. It's the key behind quantum key distribution and long distance quantum communication, and also used in quantum computing. It allows you to \"teleport\" - or move the quantum state - to another qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why do we need to do something special to copy quantum information? For classical information, we simply read the bits, and copy them to another place. We can’t do that on a quantum system. The no-cloning theorem says we cannot copy a quantum state exactly. So, we have to do something a little different. Quantum teleportation means we \"move\" the quantum state of to another qubit. This requires destroying the state of the qubit we teleported, so we do not violate no-cloning.\n",

That means the CNOT across q[1] and q[2] is activated, and NOT is applied on q[2], since q[1] was the control and equal to 1. A NOT gate is the equivalent of a X gate.
